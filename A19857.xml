         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I pray thee Chriſtian Reader, haue patience with me. I will spare thy paynes, and myne owne, as much as <hi>I</hi> can. My purpoſe is not to man out an other Galeaſſe like this <hi>Diſcourſers</hi> gallant, but to ſet vpon it with my

Neither thinke thou, I endevour hereby a defence more for my ſelfe, then for thee. I could haue contemned their frivelous reproches, had it not bene thou wert greatly endangered by the manifold groſe errors wherewith they would poyſon thee. And therfore intending thy good, more then myne owne credit, I will take a breife view of their <hi>Dialogicall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>courſes,</hi> before <hi>I</hi> come to them which properly concerne me.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> be fronted with a double epiſtle, one to the <hi>Right H. the L.

But why ſhould you feare a quippe for a poynt of learnyng, which haue inured your faces not to bluſh at grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter matters?

But ſuppoſing it were true, we muſt know that it is a iudgment, or an increaſe of this ſaid iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when beſides the vexation of Sathan, our bodies ſhalbe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle and place of aboad for the vncleane ſpirit to dwel in, which were made to be a temple for the holy ghoſt. And in this reſpect (were the <hi>antecedent</hi> true) there is ſufficient to moue the Lord to permit Sathan to enter into the bodie, and Sathan to deſire this en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trance. And thus much for your firſt concluſion, no leſſe abſurdly handled by you, then propounded. Wherein I haue bene the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe it is the maine poynt controuerted: and as it were the foundation or corner ſtone, whereon our whole buildinge doth ſtande.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond aſſertion is, That <hi>Diuels haue no true naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies peculiar to themſelues:</hi> which makes as much for his not beinge really in mens bodies, as it doth for his not being really in the Aer. But I will not follow you at euery turne, leaſt I ſhoulde too much diſtruſt the Readers iudgment: Beſides I am more then half wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie already with your ſenſe-leſſe diſputes. Many famouſly learned in the Church both of auncient time, and this preſent, attribute a kinde of bodie to Spirits, not groſſe and palpable, as theis inferior bodies be, but of an incomprehenſible ſubtilty: of which nomber are <hi>Tertullian, Auguſtine, Bernard, the Schoole-men, Zanchius</hi> with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9804:16"/> many others. Theſe <hi>Diſcourſers</hi> take vpon them firſt to refell the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which make for bodies, &amp; then propound ſome of their owne againſt them. In refelling Celeſtiall bodies they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues turne ſick Euery thing wheles ſo about with them,<note place="margin">pag 81:</note> that they know not where they are. <hi>If diuels</hi> (ſay they) <hi>haue celestiall bodies and enter into men whoſe bodyes are Elementarie, then we ſhould haue a compound ſupernaturall motion both in respect of the diuels, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion ſhould be Circuler, &amp; of the man whoſe motion is down right.</hi> As if intelligible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will therefore paſſe ouer this, and the reſt of their wiſe refutation, and come to their owne confirmation of it. How doe you prooue <hi>Spirits haue no bodies?</hi> Firſt out of theſe wordes,<note place="margin">pag 94 Luke 24:39,</note>

The argument vpon which you ground, is after this manner. <hi>If the Diuel aſſume to himſelfe a body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag 100. 101 102, 103: &amp; 104, 105.</note> 
               <hi>it is either a true body, or a phantaſticall body, one created ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or then newly, either the bodye of a liuinge man, or of a dead man: But none of all theſe, &amp; therefore no body.</hi> I anſwer firſt, that he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9804:18"/> both a true body, and a phantaſticall body: ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the other. Secondly that he taketh a created body. If you demaund by whome? I anſwer by himſelf. You reply, that creation is proper to God alone: and I reioyne, that creation is twofould. One when a thing is made of nothing, as all thinges were in the firſt begininge, in which power no creature may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any part: the other when bodies are framed of ſome matter al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ready being: In this kinde the Lord doth vſe the miniſtery of his Angels. If it ſeeme hard to giue the name of creation to this latter kinde: then I anſwer, that the body the diuel vſually aſſumeth, is an vncreated body. The matter of his body is from god &amp; from his creation, it being made of aer thickned or of ſome ſuch like matter. But the (¶) forme &amp; in that it is a body, hauing the bigneſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, colour, voyce &amp; motion of a body, is meerely from the diuel. Here by I ſay it is plaine, that it is an vncreated body<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>I</hi> doe not meane that the diuell doth forme or quicken an airie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as the soule doth our body: bvt that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him it hath the forme, fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhion, and ſhape of a bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die.</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the diuel, but not created by him.

And yet notwithſtanding it is a thing exiſting in nature, before the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel aſſume it, as euery childe may perceaue. And that this ſpirits be able to performe we cannot but acknowledge, except we ſuppoſe them to be of weaker ſtrength then other creatures. Doth not the ſunne by his heate frame in the dunghill the body of a mouſe, and giue vnto it alſo life and ſence? Philoſophie and experyence doth teach thus much. It were abſurde to imagine Angelicall natures to be of leſſe abillity then the ſunne, eſpecially in a matter of leſſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty by ſomuch, as it is more eaſy to frame &amp; aſſume a body one lye, then to quicken and endue it with ſencible forme. And why ſhould it not be as poſſible and eaſie for the diuel thus to compact and frame a body, for height, length, breadth, with all the partes &amp; due proportions thereof of any kinde whatſoeuer, like to man, dog, catt, toade, &amp;c. &amp; enter into it, as to cauſe a tempeſt, &amp; thoſe other accidents whereof we reade in the hiſtory of <hi>Iob?</hi> Thirdly I anſwer that in apparitions,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.</note> which are not properly called poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he neither taketh a liuing mans body, nor a dead mans, but only ſuch a one as is made ſpecially for that purpoſe, which when the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand is done, is diſſolued into the ſame nature it was of before. And whereas you tell vs concerning the dead mans bodie, that <hi>if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſhould aſſume the carkas of a man lately deceaſed, he ſhould appeare in a white winding ſheete:</hi> I ſee no reaſon of this <hi>windinge ſheete,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

               </note> To this end mans body was not created. But heerevnto hath man made his body ſubiect by his owne tranſgreſſion.

In the reſurrection the ſoule and body ſhall be vnited togither, and by this coniunction the body againe quickned. Now this can only Iehouah doe. And after this manner many dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies aroſe and came out of the graues, &amp; appeared to many at the reſurrection of Chriſt. But heere is no ſuch coniunction:<note place="margin">Math. 27.5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> neither doth the ſpirit aſſuming, quicken the body aſſumed. The diuel is too weake to performe either of thoſe. So that for any thing you ſay, he may take liuing or dead bodie, which he pleaſe. Thus we ſee there is no truth nor ſoundnes in this argument, but a meere tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling &amp; abuſing of the Reader, as wel concluding that neither good angels can poſſibly take bodies vpon them (contrary to the exp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe truth in the ſcripture) as that the wicked cannot.

Haue you found out a difference in the <hi>eſſence</hi> of good and wicked Angels? All ſound deuines hitherto haue made their difference only in their quality. But you are nothing dainty of ſuch nouelties. Wel to let this paſſe: How ſhew you there is a diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of them in this poynt? In this ſort: <hi>The priuiledg of celeſtiall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is not incident to the infernall.</hi> To graunt you this, what doe you build from hence? But to aſſume a body is the priuiledge of celeſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all angels. This is a ſecond vntruth. You were aſhamed it may be, to expreſſe it plainly (I would be glad to heare you were growne ſo baſhfull) but it muſt neceſſarily be vnderſtood. If to aſſume bodies were the celeſtiall angels priuiledg, the Lord which is the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thir priuiledges, would neuer haue ſuffered Sathan to haue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9804:19"/> entred into the body of the ſerpent.

And this knowledg and power they haue.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſay you, <hi>the bodies wherein good Angels appeared, were not created by themſelues,</hi>

               <hi>but by god.</hi> I anſwer, if they were ſuch as were imediatly made of nothing, the Lord was the only workman of them: but if of ſome forebeeinge matter, their miniſtery might haue a place. But admit they were immediatly made, may not the Lord alſo create bodies for wicked ſpirits to vſe in their ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices? You imply <hi>he will not.</hi> It is preſumption to ſearch further i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to God his will, then his word and actions doe warrant vs: and it is blindneſſe not to acknowledg ſo much, as they leade vs vnto.

               <note place="margin">Act. 7, 53: Galat. 3.19.</note> You ſee then how trife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this argument is. But you will ſay: In the giuing of the lawe, the ſcripture doth warrant a miniſtery of angels, but in the matter of <hi>Balaam</hi> no ſuch thing is any where taught.

            <p>Greate cauſe therefore had thoſe famous learned men <hi>Lyra, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Zanchius, &amp;c.</hi> to acknowledg an angell in this buſyneſſe, whoſe iudgments if you had wayed and followed, it had bene more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for you, then thus to roue at randome with your bolts.

And why ſhould Angels neceſſarily be ſent in perſon to thoſe ſeueral places where buſineſſe lye, if they were able to accompliſh them being abſent?

            <p>Therefore I neede not trouble the Reader with diſcuſſing, <hi>How the diuell is tranſformed into an angel of light,</hi> or <hi>how Nebuchadnezzar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an oxe,</hi> or in ripping vp any of that diſcourſe following, onlie let vs conſider that which is alleadged from our Sauiour Chriſtes ſpeach,<note place="margin">pag 156. 157 Luk. 24, 38.</note>

The diſciples might haue replyed, that howſoeuer ſpirits haue not fleſh and bones naturally, yet they aſſume humane bodies for a time, viſible and palpable, &amp; therefore the iudgment of ſence could not be ſufficient warrant to put away their feare. For anſwer heerevnto, <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> &amp; other of the <hi>Schoole men</hi> think, our Sauiours argument to be of ſmall ſtrength, except ſome other addition be made vnto it.

And that you may be cut of doubt, looke vpon me, and handle me. A ſpirit hath not a true naturall body, conſiſtinge of fleſh, bloud, and bone &amp;c. but only the ſimilitude of theſe things, and therefore this my true humane body you may eaſily diſcerne from ſuch, if care and circumſpection be vſed by you: View me therefore well, and handle me. The ſoftneſſe of my fleſh, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of my bones, that vitall and ſweete warmneſſe that is percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in a liuing body, and is proper vnto it, which you may feele, doe witneſſe that it is my body you doe behould, and not a ſpirit. But certaine may you be hereof, if you looke vpon my hands and feete, which you know (according to the ſcripture) were lately peirced. Heere I ſhew you them. Doe you not ſee the marks there of? and the hoales which the nayles haue made in them? we may add heerevnto the exceeding great ioy which did heerevpon ariſe in the diſciples. For it followeth, <hi>And while they beleued not for ioy,</hi> that the Lord was riſen, <hi>&amp; wondred thereat</hi> &amp;c.

A very eaſie matter: euen as it is for one in ſtraits to helpe himſelfe with a lye.

               <note place="margin">Galat. 3:10</note> This ſentence is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true to the ende of the world.

Beeſides the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are not exempted from the temporall chaſticement.

               <hi>as praier is either vocall, or perſonall, &amp; that whether we respect the natural guift, or ſupernatural, this being alſo either principall or inſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rumentall, and therefore prayer &amp; faſting haue no power at all.</hi> For pr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>oofe of the aſſumption we haue a long discourſe of ſix or ſeauen le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aues to no purpoſe, but onely to ſpend time, of the cauſe of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operations, a thinge knowne to all, but entred into Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and I thanke the lord not doubted of by me. To let goe there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore all your needeleſſe talke, I anſwer breifly, that the power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from our praiers was perſonall, (if yov take perſonall as you ought, and as learned men doe for an acceptation of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not for the principall inherency of this power in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) not of my ſelfe onely, but of all his faithfull people then aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled together, accepted by god the father in the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt. Secondly that this perſonall power was ſupernaturall, dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ending onely vpon god his inſtitution, and promiſe made to praier,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9804:38"/> not vpon any naturall efficacie whatſoeuer. Thirdly that this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was inſtrumentall, not principall.

That becauſe this power is inſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mental, therfore it is not perſonal: which both may ſtand together, and doe in all the children of god. But if you will take perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a peculiar fancie of your owne brayne, for a primary be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of this power in our perſons, then is your firſt diſtribution chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Like ſtuffe it is when you oppoſe the <hi>power of God, and the meanes,</hi> whereas both vſually concurre in all actions.

               <hi>That this kind goeth not forth but by prayer and fasting.</hi> But becauſe theſe words are oft alleaged, and being truly vnderſtood, make much for this cauſe, I will open the meaning of them, as I now vpon more deliberation conceiue them. Something I differ from that which hitherto I haue followed, but I take it, this which I ſhall now remember, is moſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9804:39"/> agreable to our Sauiours meaning: And I wil neuer be aſhamed to reforme my iudgment. where I ſee truth doth ouerſway me. Thus then I doe interpret them. Whereas the Diſciples demaunded why they could not caſte forth that diuel, Our Sauiour doth anſwer to this effect: Becauſe (ſaith he) you are deſtitute of that faith &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which once you had,<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> when I ſent you forth to preach by two and by two, vnto the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This then was your firſt errour. Secondly you failed in this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your extraordinary guift wanted, notwithſtanding you ſet vpon this worke extraordinarily: whereas in this caſe, you ſhould onely haue betaken your ſelues to the ordinary courſe, which is faſtinge and prayer: for this kinde of divel wherewith the childe is poſſeſſed goeth forth by no other meanes then the vſuall and common way of humbling your ſelues, and intreating the ſame with al earneſtnes at the Lordes handes: vnderſtandinge me of the ordinary meanes. This interpretation ariſeth moſt properly out of the wordes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence: wherein the failing of faith in the diſciples, is an vtter defect of miraculous faith: the vſe of faſting and prayer is not an helpe to weake miraculous faith, which now in the diſciples was none at all, but the ordinary meanes where miraculous faith fayl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the friuolous arguments, whereby you would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the efficacie of Gods ordinance for the caſtinge forth of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than by faſtinge and prayer as the meanes of wakening &amp; ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of faith, to which the Lord graunteth all behouefull requeſts to his children.

Such was the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sunne in the time of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and the turning back of the ſhaddow to confirme <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> and ſuch others. Some are not mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uelous for the greatneſſe of the thing done, but for the manner v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in doing, as was the cloud and rayne of <hi>Elyas,</hi> the thundering of <hi>Samuell,</hi> and of the like ſort. For ſuch things are done naturally, but at that time were miracles in regard of the manner by which they were effected, that is, not by naturall cauſes, but at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and wil of the Saints.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9804:41"/> of mans miniſtery, but the manner of doing, as hath bene ſhewed in the ſecond diſtinction of Miracles. As for example, The cloud and the rayne ſent at <hi>Elyas</hi> prayer was a miracle, becauſe the Lord had reuealed it vnto him, and he had embraced the ſame by faith know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing when and how it ſhould be ſent. Yet when the Church of God in the time of drought and famyne, ſhall by publique praier obtaine cloudes &amp; rayne, this is no miracle. As when <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8:35:</note> 
               <hi>when hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen ſhall be ſhut vp, and there ſhall be no rayne, becauſe they haue ſinned againſt thee, and ſhall pray in this place, and confeſſe thy name, &amp; turn from their ſinne, when thou doeſt afflict them, Then heare thou in heauen, and giue raine vpon the earth &amp;c.</hi> Doth he here pray they might be releeued by miracle? Nay, but ſheweth what the ordinary courſe of the Church is in this caſe. So when the Diſciples caſt forth diuels by their myraculous faith, and the Church now a daies by faſting &amp; prayer, the ſame worke in ſubſtance is done by both, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing is much differing,<note place="margin">S. Doctrine pag. 35</note> which makes a difference alſo in the Action, and cauſeth that theire worke was miraculous, &amp; the ſame done by the Church in theſe times not to be miraculous. This little may ſuffice for diſtinct vnderſtanding of this doctrine: which dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerued will preſerue vs from thoſe horrible down-fals into which theſe blinde <hi>Diſcourſers</hi> tvmble themſelues. Now then to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amine theirs.</p>
            <p>Firſt we haue a definition of <hi>a Miracle</hi> in generall, to be <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traordinary worke of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 306. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>highly ſurmounting the whole faculty of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry created nature, to worke admiration in the beholders, and to confirme their faith in the truth of Gods word.</hi> Next we haue it deuided into the <hi>ſeuerall kindes,</hi> whereof the one is <hi>a True miracle,</hi> the other <hi>a falſe</hi> From whence it muſt needs follow that the generall definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt alſo agree to a <hi>falſe</hi> miracle. And that therefore <hi>a falſe miracle is an extraordinary worke of God, highly ſurmounting the whole faculty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery created nature, to confirme the ſaith of the beholders in the truth of the worde.</hi> But this is a thing moſt abſurd once to dreame of. Seing then to make a Generall whoſe definition can not agree to the Specialls, is a worke aboue nature: and that <hi>M. Deacon</hi> &amp; <hi>M.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That miracles are not yet ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas I affirme, <hi>That caſting forth of diuels in theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by faſting &amp; prayer is no miracle</hi> becauſe it is done by ordinary meanes without the miraculous faith, (in which ſence onely I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand meanes, the vſe whereof maketh a worke to be no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9804:42"/> you keepe a fooliſh iangling about this, in three pages togither without either head or foote.<note place="margin">page. 311,</note> Onely when in one place you began to conclude, according to your abſurd manner you oppoſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power of God, to his appointed meanes, as if ther were deadlie feude betwene them, ſo that they muſt needes kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one an other. May it not be ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> by his miraculous faith &amp; his rod deuided the ſea, as by the meanes, becauſe the Lord in truth wrought the thinge by his owne mighty arme?</p>
            <p>Moreouer to ſtop your brawling mouthes you haue beene tould,<note place="margin">pag. 312. &amp;c.</note> that <hi>Caſting forth of diuils in this ſort, is a thing marueylous, but not miraculous.</hi> Which difference, if you were not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly depriued of common ſence, you might eaſily perceaue to be no leſſe then is betwene the Generall &amp; the Speciall. Euery Miracu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lous thing is marueylous, but not euery Marueylous thing miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.<note place="margin">geneſ: 43:36.</note> Except it was a miracle that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> placed his brethren accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their auncyentie, becauſe the Aegiptians marueiled at it. <hi>Cato</hi> marueyled that one wyſard, when he ſaw an other, could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare laughing, was this forbearance of laughing in the wiſardes a miracle? If this might paſſe for currant, we ſhould haue as many mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles as we haue fooles, and ſo the world full of miracles. But you will proue it by Hebrew that <hi>Marueyles &amp; Miracles are all one,</hi> bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſe <hi>Oth</hi> &amp; <hi>Mopheth</hi> are the ſame. But firſt you ſhould haue proued that all marueyles are eyther <hi>Oth</hi> or <hi>Mopheth:</hi> which you neuer goe about: and it were but loſt labour you ſhould. So then the whole diſcourſe for nine pages togither, is an euident reaſoning from the affirmation of the Generall, to the Speciall: as if one ſhoulde ſay thus, That which is a liuing creature is M. <hi>Deacon</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Walker:</hi> But an <hi>Oxe</hi> is a liuing creature, and diuers others his cooſen ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes beſides: Therefore an Oxe by this Logike ſhould be as wiſe as your ſelues. Surely you have found the Philoſophers ſtone wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich is able to turne leade into gould: you can doe more then the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rits can: for you haue proued and I alſo beleeue it, they cannot tr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſforme one nature into an other, which I ſee is within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of your Omnipotency.</p>
            <p>You returne a freſh to <hi>Miracles wrought by meanes.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which I tell you againe (for ſuch importunate beggars wil not reſt with one anſwer) that whatſoeuer is wrought by ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes onely,<note place="margin">pag: 321. &amp;c</note> without miraculous faith, is no miracle. Now if you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew that <hi>Moſes, Elijah, Eliſha, Peter</hi> and the reſt wrought their ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mirable workes in ſuch manner, then I will eſteeme you for great

The ſyllogiſme mentioneth onely <hi>true Miracles,</hi> &amp; therefore your diſtinction muſt needes be, That true miracles are of two ſorts, either true or falſe, (which is your former miraculous diuiſion) or elſe you leaue the matter where it was,<note place="margin">page, 306: pag: 324.</note> yealding that Anti-chriſt doth worke true mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles. But forſooth you will goe ſtrictly to worke, and after ſome nipping diſiunctiues, at laſt you diſcend to this, that <hi>If I wrought a wonder at Mahgnition, then I wrought an vndoubted true miracle.</hi> muſt you needes ſtill inferre a Speciall from the affirmation of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall? You abound in ſuch admirable concluſions. Where you ſay, that <hi>Expelling of Spirits, is no leſſe maruelous now, then it was in the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitiue Church.</hi> If you meane the Church in the Apoſtles time, you ſay vntruly: It was done by miraculous faith then, it is not ſo now, which makes a difference in the worke, as hath bene ſhewed in <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ah</hi> his cloude, and that which is ordinarily obteyned by prayer. And this is all you can ſay to proue that <hi>Exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The reſt of this Dialogue is ſpent in prouing that <hi>Myracles are ceaſed,</hi> wherein I might be ſilent, both conſidering Diſpoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe times is no miracle, and therefore nothinge at all im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peached by this diſcourſe, and alſo for that I graunt the cealinge of miracles according to ſuch diſtinction: as hath bene before ſett downe, that is, as they be wrought by the miniſtery of man. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any thing you bring weaken this truth, but rather much confirme it. Yet in handling this poynt you haue diuers vnſounde poſitions. As if there were no other ende of miracles, but <hi>the teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſt his Deity, &amp; the confirmation of the Goſpell,</hi> whereas Miracles doe as well confirme the Law, as the Goſpell, Iudgment, as wel as Mercy. And the Lord alwaies hath &amp; will teſtify his wrath from heauen againſt ſinners,<note place="margin">page 325.</note> which will not beleeue the threatnings of his word to forſake their wicked waies. Againe, ſay you, <hi>Chriſts reſurrection was the laſt Miracle for confirmation of his Deity.</hi> Then what was his Aſcention into heauen? Is it nothing with you? It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And as for <hi>the gap to knauery,</hi> what window can be opened, when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of man is wholly excluded, &amp; theſe wondrous workes left im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediatly to the Lord himſelfe? you are mad when you ſee not the difference betwene the Papiſts dealing in this buſineſſe,<note place="margin">pag. 327.</note> and that of the Church of God. <hi>D.

All your reaſons againſt Miracles conclude on lye againſt ſuch as are done by the miniſtery of man: and ſo likewiſe your teſtimonyes vnto which I willingly ſubſcribe. Onely, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, marke that <hi>D.

There is no ſuch office left by Chriſt: but that a faithfull congregation making ſuite to the Lord in the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diation of his Sonne, hath no promiſe to obtaine the deliuerance of their brethren from the vexation of diuels, it neuer came into his heart (for any thing I could euer ſee by his writings) to thinke. But theſe men according to their manner, alleadg one thing for an other: euery clod in the fallow, is an hare with them, and they can follow it with as full cry, as if the beſt game that is were on foote be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore them. Well now, Chriſtian Reader, that I haue layd open ther dealing vnto thee, be thou thy ſelfe Iudge, whether in the begining my ſpeach exceeded any thing or no.

But if any can diſproue the actions that haue bene done for matter of fact, or any thing that I haue deliuered or taught, by ſound doctrine out of the truth of God his worde, I will giue glorie to the Lord, &amp; confeſſe my ſelf to haue erred and bene deceaued, al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though for deceauing, the God of heauen &amp; earth is witnes it neuer came into my harte.

But as concerning your ſelfe, we doe vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly thinke, that the ſame was ſimply your errour in iudgment, but no purpoſed errour in your practiſe at all.</hi> This is your teſtimony.

Your booke comes forth by his priuiledge. No doubt it was peruſed, &amp; peruſed againe. It lay a long time in his handes. And who can tell whether this teſtimony be not his owne

Neyther ſkills it greatly whether he writt theſe very wordes or no, conſidering he hath allowed &amp; approued them at leaſt, in giuing them publique paſſage and priuiledg to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therefore though <hi>S.

How good and gratious is the Lord which bringeth forth the righteouſneſſe of his ſeruants as the light, &amp; their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the noone day. As he dealt with our heade Chriſt in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Pilat</hi> to pronounce him a iuſt man, ſo he dealeth with his poore members accordinge to their ſeuerall degrees. Hee made <hi>Saul</hi> acknowledg <hi>Dauid</hi> more righteous then him ſelfe, &amp; <hi>Agrippa</hi> &amp; <hi>Feſtus</hi> to ſay of <hi>Paule, He had done nothing worthy of bonds.</hi> To this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely wiſe, &amp; gratious, &amp; Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lord God, the father, the Sonne, &amp; the holy ſpirit, be all honor &amp; praiſe for euer &amp; euer.</p>
